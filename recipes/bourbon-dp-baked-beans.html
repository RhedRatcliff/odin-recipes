    <h1>Description:</h1>
   <p>I came up with this recipe after having made some bourbon baked beans and seeing a recipe for cola baked beans and I thought: Why not combine the two?</p>
   <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 (12 fl oz) can caffeinated pepper-type soda (such as Dr Pepper)</li>
    <li>3/4 cup ketchup</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li> 8 slices bacon</li>
    <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/4 cup bourbon</li>
    <li>2 (16 ounce) cans baked beans with pork</li>
   </ul>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
    <li>Mix brown sugar, paprika, mustard, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Whisk in pepper soda, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce until brown sugar is dissolved. </li>
    <li>Cut 4 slices of bacon into small strips. Cook and stir in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until almost crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, reserving bacon grease. </li>
    <li>Stir onion into the bacon grease in the Dutch oven; cook and stir until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute. Pour in bourbon, stirring to scrape up browned bits off the bottom with a wooden spoon. Stir bacon strips back in.</li>
    <li>Pour brown sugar mixture and baked beans into the Dutch oven. Simmer until beans are heated through, about 15 minutes. Arrange remaining 4 slices of bacon on top of the beans. </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven, covered, until beans are bubbly and sauce is syrupy, about 3 hours. </li>

   </ol>
